# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to use deep-learning neural networks with TensorFlow in Python, to analyze and classify the success of charitable donations.
We use the following methods for the analysis:
* preprocessing the data for the neural network model,
* compile, train and evaluate the model,
* optimize the model.
